# mco-parking-status

Orlando International Airport publishes the [availability of their parking garages](https://orlandoairports.net/parking-transportation/parking/) 24/7.
Being a city whose population has doubled in 30 years, even the economy lots frequently reach 100% capacity during peak season.
This app scrapes the MCO website and succinctly displays that data in a single page that's much nicer to look at.

## Quickstart

This app uses SvelteKit + Typescript. Just `npm i` and you're good to get started developing.
